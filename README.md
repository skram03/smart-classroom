Smart Classroom System

The Smart Classroom System is an IoT-powered automation project designed to enhance classroom efficiency and improve the learning environment. It automatically controls lights and fans based on occupancy and temperature, ensuring energy saving and comfort without manual effort.

This system also features a QR-code attendance mechanism with real-time parent notifications, making attendance faster, transparent, and digitized. A built-in voice assistant allows hands-free interaction, while the ESP8266 enables smooth wireless communication with server modules.

The project integrates Arduino, IoT sensors, ESP8266, and Python (Flask/Django) to deliver a smart, connected, and modern classroom experience that reduces workload for teachers and improves overall classroom management.
